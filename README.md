- 👋 Hi, I’m @BSchoepkeDev
- 👀 I’m interested in music, coding, gaming. The first and the last I have done for ages, since I am a professional composer and sounddesigner, but coding is quite new to me.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning javascript (&phaser), but also: c, c++, c#, python. I am currently studying computer science beside my job. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...mostly gaming related stuff. But might take a look into digital signal processing as well.
- 📫 How to reach me: bjoernschoepke.de is a good start; but feel free any way which comes across you
